<h2> Introduction </h2>
Before a pharmaceutical drug is made available to the public, it needs to go through rigorous and lengthy clinical testing and regulatory approvals, spanning 6 to 7 years and costing between $160 million to $2 billion per new drug. The testing process involves clinical trials which are conducted in 3 main phases to ensure a drug’s safety and effectiveness before it can be considered for approval. Phase 1 involves a small group of healthy volunteers to evaluate safety and determine appropriate dosage. If successful, the drug moves to Phase 2, which tests its effectiveness in a few hundred patients and continues to monitor side effects. Phase 3 expands to several hundred or thousands of patients to confirm the drug’s efficacy. Upon successful completion, the drug may be submitted for regulatory approval.

<h2> Problem Statement </h2>
To understand the key factors influencing the 1) duration of a clinical trial and the 2) approval status of the drug being tested. <br>
<br>
<h2> Goals </h2>
1)	To provide a broad analysis of the pharmaceutical industry. <br> 
2)	To conduct a detailed analysis on the effect of various trial variables on clinical trial duration and drug approval. <br> 
3)	To forecast the successful approval of drugs and completion of clinical trials from 2025 to 2028. <br>
4)	Make recommendations on how to increase drug approval rate based on analysis of data. <br>
<br>
<h2> Target Audience </h2>
1)	The Chief Regulatory Officer (CRO) of a pharmaceutical company looking to increase the approval rate of their drug development pipeline. <br>
2)	A Venture Capitalist in the pharma industry evaluating risk and timeline of returns on drug development investments. <br>
3)	An Academic Researcher in the field of public health studying the factors influencing clinical trial efficiency and drug approval rates. <br>
<br>
<h2> Data Sources </h2>
1)	Phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trial data from clinicatrial.gov <br>
2)	Common drug names, approval status, ATC class, and names from drugbank.com. <br>
3)	First approval date and highest development phase from ChEMBL. <br>
<br>
<h2> Data Limitation </h2>
The information on approval status and approval dates are only for unique drugs and does not include the same drug that were tested for different conditions or dosages.
