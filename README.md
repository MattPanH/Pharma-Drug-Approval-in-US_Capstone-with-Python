Introduction
Before a pharmaceutical drug is made available to the public, it needs to go through rigorous and lengthy clinical testing and regulatory approvals, spanning 6 to 7 years and costing between $160 million to $2 billion per new drug. The testing process involves clinical trials which are conducted in 3 main phases to ensure a drug’s safety and effectiveness before it can be considered for approval. Phase 1 involves a small group of healthy volunteers to evaluate safety and determine appropriate dosage. If successful, the drug moves to Phase 2, which tests its effectiveness in a few hundred patients and continues to monitor side effects. Phase 3 expands to several hundred or thousands of patients to confirm the drug’s efficacy. Upon successful completion, the drug may be submitted for regulatory approval.

Problem Statement
To understand the key factors influencing the 1) duration of a clinical trial and the 2) approval status of the drug being tested. 

Goals
a)	To provide a broad analysis of the pharmaceutical industry
b)	To conduct a detailed analysis on the effect of various trial variables on clinical trial duration and drug approval 
c)	To forecast the successful approval of drugs and completion of clinical trials from 2025 to 2028.
d)	Make recommendations on how to increase drug approval rate based on analysis of data.

Target Audience
a)	The Chief Regulatory Officer (CRO) of a pharmaceutical company looking to increase the approval rate of their drug development pipeline.
b)	A Venture Capitalist in the pharma industry evaluating risk and timeline of returns on drug development investments.
c)	An Academic Researcher in the field of public health studying the factors influencing clinical trial efficiency and drug approval rates.

Data Sources
a)	Phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trial data from clinicatrial.gov
b)	Common drug names, approval status, ATC class, and names from drugbank.com.
c)	First approval date and highest development phase from ChEMBL.

Data Limitation
The information on approval status and approval dates are only for unique drugs and does not include the same drug that were tested for different conditions or dosages.
